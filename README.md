# Mini-InstaPay

## Overview
Mini-InstaPay is a **C#-based** digital payment application inspired by InstaPay. The project focuses on providing **secure, real-time, and efficient** money transfers. Users can send and receive funds, manage multiple bank accounts, and track transaction histories with ease.

## Features
✅ Secure and real-time transactions  
✅ Multi-bank account management  
✅ Transaction history tracking  
✅ User-friendly interface  
✅ Efficient and scalable architecture  

## Design Patterns Used
The project implements **five design patterns** to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability:

1. **Singleton** – Ensures a single instance of key services (e.g., transaction manager).  
2. **Factory** – Encapsulates object creation for different payment methods.  
3. **Builder** – Facilitates step-by-step construction of complex transaction objects.  
4. **Command** – Implements an undoable transaction system by encapsulating requests as objects.  
5. **Proxy** – Adds an additional layer of security and optimizes access to bank APIs.  

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** C#  
- **Framework:** .NET Core  
- **Security:** Encryption & authentication mechanisms
